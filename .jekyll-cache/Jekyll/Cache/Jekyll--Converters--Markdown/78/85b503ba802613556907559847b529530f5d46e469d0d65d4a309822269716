I"n<p>JavaScript <strong>strict mode</strong> is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that enables us to code a program, or a method in a “strict” operating context. It means, the errors which are being ignored by the compiler, will throw an exception message. It is a way to opt into a restricted version of JavaScript i.e implicitly opting-out of “sloppy mode”.</p>
