I"ñ<p>Having had a few awesome mentors in my life, I realize the importance of having someone to guide and validate your ideas. However, I also realize that not everyone has access to mentorship.</p>

<p>To step towards better inclusion, I am opening up my mailbox to anyone looking to discuss anything from graduate admissions to research internships.</p>

<p>Feel free to e-mail me at <a href="mailto:ayanbag9474@gmail.com">ayanbag9474@gmail.com</a> and I will find some time to chat with you!</p>
