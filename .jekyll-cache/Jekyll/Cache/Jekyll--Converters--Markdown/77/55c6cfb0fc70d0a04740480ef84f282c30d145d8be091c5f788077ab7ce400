I"v<p>The <strong>Ramer–Douglas–Peucker Algorithm</strong> is a an algorithms that reduce the number of points that is approximated by a series of points. It is also known as the <strong>Douglas–Peucker algorithm</strong> and <strong>iterative end-point fit algorithm</strong>. In simple words, it represent a complex line with fewer points in a visually proper way.</p>
