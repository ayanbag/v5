<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/ayanbag/Video_Classfication_Using_Single_Frame_CNN">Video Classification using Single Frame CNN</a> :</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Build a video classifier using <strong>Single Frame CNN</strong> technique, to classify videos against a set of categories or classes.</li>
  <li>Our model is able to attain **an accuracy of about 98% on the test set based on UCF50 dataset</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/ayanbag/Image_Captioning_using_RNN_and_CNN">Image Captioning Using RNN and CNN techniques</a> :</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Developed an <strong>attention-based model</strong> using Convolutional Neural Network Encoder and Recurrent Neural Network Decoder, which enables us to generate suitable caption for the given image.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Used more than 30,000 images from MS-COCO dataset to train our model and achieved an average <strong>BLEU Score of 0.512</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/ayanbag/ImageCompressor">Lossy Image Compression Using SVD And FFT</a> :</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Explored various image and signal processing techniques like <strong>Singulation Value Decomposition (SVD)</strong> and <strong>Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Developed an image compression algorithm by combining <strong>SVD</strong> and <strong>FFT</strong>, and compared our proposed algorithm with CT Compression algroithm at
different compression ratio in terms of <strong>Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)</strong> and <strong>Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)</strong> values.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/ayanbag/Graduate_Admission_Prediction">A Comparative Study of Regression Algorithms for Predicting Graduate Admission to a University</a> :</strong> <br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Worked and explored various Regression Algorithms like <b>Linear Regression</b>, <b>Decision Trees</b> and <b>Random Forest</b> to predict the
chance of admission to a university in the United States based on their profile i.e GRE Score, TOEFL Score, Work Experience, Research Experience and 
various factors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compared three well-known Regression Algorithms against the problem statement and proved that <strong>Linear Regression</strong> is much better than other regression
regression algorithms like <strong>Decision Trees</strong> and <strong>Random Forest</strong> in terms of accuracy to predict the chances of admission to a university 
when evaluated on unseen data.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
