### Academic Projects :

**[Video Classification using Single Frame CNN](https://github.com/ayanbag/Video_Classfication_Using_Single_Frame_CNN) :**

- Build a video classifier using **Single Frame CNN** technique, to classify videos against a set of categories or classes.
- Our model is able to attain **an accuracy of about 98%** on the test set based on UCF50 dataset

**[Image Captioning Using RNN and CNN techniques](https://github.com/ayanbag/Image_Captioning_using_RNN_and_CNN) :**

- Developed an **attention-based model** using Convolutional Neural Network Encoder and Recurrent Neural Network Decoder, which enables us to generate suitable caption for the given image.

- Used more than 30,000 images from MS-COCO dataset to train our model and achieved an average **BLEU Score of 0.512**

**[Lossy Image Compression Using SVD And FFT](https://github.com/ayanbag/ImageCompressor) :**

- Explored various image and signal processing techniques like **Singulation Value Decomposition (SVD)** and **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**

- Developed an image compression algorithm by combining **SVD** and **FFT**, and compared our proposed algorithm with CT Compression algroithm at
different compression ratio in terms of **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)** and **Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)** values.


**[A Comparative Study of Regression Algorithms for Predicting Graduate Admission to a University](https://github.com/ayanbag/Graduate_Admission_Prediction) :** <br/>

- Worked and explored various Regression Algorithms like <b>Linear Regression</b>, <b>Decision Trees</b> and <b>Random Forest</b> to predict the
chance of admission to a university in the United States based on their profile i.e GRE Score, TOEFL Score, Work Experience, Research Experience and 
various factors. 

- Compared three well-known Regression Algorithms against the problem statement and proved that **Linear Regression** is much better than other regression
regression algorithms like **Decision Trees** and **Random Forest** in terms of accuracy to predict the chances of admission to a university 
when evaluated on unseen data.
