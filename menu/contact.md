Having had a few awesome mentors in my life, I realize the importance of having someone to guide and validate your ideas. However, I also realize that not everyone has access to mentorship.

To step towards better inclusion, I am opening up my mailbox to anyone looking to discuss anything from graduate admissions to research internships.

Feel free to e-mail me at [ayanbag9474@gmail.com](mailto:ayanbag9474@gmail.com) and I will find some time to chat with you!
